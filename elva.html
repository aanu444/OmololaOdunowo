                <h6>IN THE BEGINNING:</h6>
                <span>Elva Technologies is a Software Development Company based in Lagos, Nigeria. As one of its first 
                    Product Managers, I was able to effectively set the foundation for the company’s product culture by
                     experimenting with lean start-up frameworks like scrum and kanban in fostering an increase in the 
                     teams work efficiency as well as their collaboration to execution rate which recorded a 60% increase 
                     within the first 2 months of its implementation. I also executed high level business strategies in 
                     expanding on the early business positioning of the Company, ensuring accurate market studies were 
                     conducted and 
                    stronger business strategies were implemented for effective business growth short to long term.  </span>

                <h6>MY CONTRIBUTIONS:</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>Implemented and owned the company’s product vision and ensured team alignment across all product platforms</li>
                    <li>Trained Product Managers in meeting with company processes and creatively executing on product platforms to further expand the growth of the business</li>
                    <li>Changed the face of the business in line with concrete observatory statistics that saw an increase in client to business patronage on projects</li>
                    <li>Implemented business level strategies that fostered an increased adoption to conversion and revenue generation rate across platform product; Elva Learn Academy</li>
                    <li>Worked iteratively with cross functional teams in ensuring product transparency at all times. Alternated between Scrum and Kanban frameworks with product teams in observing and fostering better processes to speed up development to completion rate</li>
                    <li>Identified business opportunities by translating trends into on-brand product solutions that effectively communicate the company’s vision and business goals</li>
                </ul>

                <h6>RESULTS:</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>Implemented a company specific ScrumBan process that increased work efficiency by 80% in 2 years</li>

                    <li>Launched the EdTech platform product early and on budget. Armed with data from its first cohort, I leveraged strategies to build a stronger platform system which saw signups for its second cohort go up by 46% within 1 month of its implementation.</li>
                    <li>Implemented value oriented newsletters that saw user to product platform sign ups grow by 20% two months post execution. Handed over to marketing for adoption across all platforms thereafter</li>
